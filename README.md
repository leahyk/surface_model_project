# surface_model_project
I completed this project as a demonstration of my Solidworks surface modeling skills during Fall 2023 for my Mechanical Engineering Design 1 course at Colorado State University. 
This project was modeled after an actual object, and the photos of the object are overlayed in the file. 
Usually engineers use solid bodies to model in Solidworks, but this project aimed to only use surface modeling tools.
